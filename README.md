## Overview
The Diabetes Detector is an Android application designed to identify potential symptoms of diabetes by utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and machine learning algorithms. The app processes images to detect and analyze relevant indicators that may suggest the presence of diabetes, offering users a simple yet powerful tool for early detection and awareness.

## Features
**Image Recognition:** Captures and processes images to identify potential diabetes symptoms.
**OCR Technology**: Extracts text from images to analyze specific symptoms or medical indicators.
**Machine Learning**: Utilizes trained models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the extracted data.
**User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a focus on ease of use, making it accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
